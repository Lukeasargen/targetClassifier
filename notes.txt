best_model = copy.deepcopy(net.state_dict())

numbers to beat
letter: 79.7%
letter_color: 94.1%
shape: 95.5%
shape_color: 99.0%

todo
-lr scheduler, StepLR was causing problems with optimization
-label weights
-class weights, harder shapes and letters get weighted more (or sampled more?)
-model save after epochs
-visualize the metrics, confusion matrix
